# Unity-Game-Prototype-1

This is the current game I am working on. 
Its based off of a childhood game that I used to play with my friends called Infection.
One player is the monster and their goal is to infect every player.
Players goals are to either escape from the map, kill the monster, or complete all the puzzles.
Those who are infected become a monster and can return as a player by infecting another player.

This game currently uses Mirror to handle networking and multiplayer functions.
Right now it is using a server-client base network meaning players can host or join others.

This game contains assets that I have 3-D modelled myself and it's still a work in progress.
